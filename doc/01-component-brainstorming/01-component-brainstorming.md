# Portfolio Part 1: Component Brainstorming

- **Name**: Pierre van Zyl
- **Dot Number**: vanzyl.3
- **Due Date**: 2/4/2025

## Assignment Overview

The overall goal of the portfolio project is to have you design and implement
your own OSU component. There are no limits to what you choose to design and
implement, but your component must fit within the constraints of our software
sequence discipline. In other words, the component must extend from Standard and
must include both a kernel and a secondary interface.

Because this is a daunting project, we will be providing you with a series of
activities to aid in your design decisions. For example, the point of this
assignment is to help you brainstorm a few possible components and get some
feedback. For each of these components, you will need to specify the high-level
design in terms of the software sequence discipline. In other words, you will
describe a component, select a few kernel methods for your component, and select
a few secondary methods to layer on top of your kernel methods.

You are not required to specify contracts at this time. However, you are welcome
to be as detailed as you'd like. More detail means you will be able to get more
detailed feedback, which may help you decide which component to ultimately
implement.

## Assignment Checklist

To be sure you have completed everything on this assignment, we have littered
this document with TODO comments. You can browse all of them in VSCode by
opening the TODOs window from the sidebar. The icon looks like a tree and will
likely have a large number next to it indicating the number of TODOS. You'll
chip away at that number over the course of the semester. However, if you'd
like to remove this number, you can disable it by removing the following
line from the `settings.json` file:

```json
"todo-tree.general.showActivityBarBadge": true,
```

Which is not to be confused with the following setting that adds the counts
to the tree diagram (you may remove this one as well):

```json
"todo-tree.tree.showCountsInTree": true,
```

## Assignment Learning Objectives

Without learning objectives, there really is no clear reason why a particular
assessment or activity exists. Therefore, to be completely transparent, here is
what we're hoping you will learn through this particular aspect of the portfolio
project. Specifically, students should be able to:

1. Integrate their areas of interest in their personal lives and/or careers with
   their knowledge of software design
2. Determine the achievablility of a software design given time constraints
3. Design high-level software components following the software sequence
   discipline

## Assignment Rubric: 10 Points

Again, to be completely transparent, most of the portfolio project, except the
final submission, is designed as a formative assessment. Formative assessments
are meant to provide ongoing feedback in the learning process. Therefore,
the rubric is designed to assess the learning objectives *directly* in a way
that is low stakesâ€”meaning you shouldn't have to worry about the grade. Just
do good work.

Below is further rationale/explanation for the rubric items above:

1. Each design must align with your personal values and long-term
   goals. Because the goal of this project is to help your build out a
   portfolio, you really ought to care about what you're designing. We'll give
   you a chance to share your personal values, interests, and long-term goals
   below.
2. Each design must be achievable over the course of a single
   semester. Don't be afraid to design something very small. There is no shame
   in keeping it simple.
3. Each design must fit within the software sequence discipline. In
   other words, your design should expect to inherit from Standard, and it
   should contain both kernel and secondary methods. Also, null and aliasing
   must be avoided, when possible. The methods themselves must also be in
   justifiable locations, such as kernel or secondary.

Honestly at this point I am still mostly unsure what I want out of a career. I
am pretty sure I want to be a software developer, but I would also be happy to
do anything in engineering. Some of my personal activities include swimming and
playing Dungeons and Dragons with friends.

## Assignment

As previously stated, you are tasked with brainstorming 3 possible components.
To aid you in this process, we have provided [some example components][example-components]
that may help you in your brainstorming. All of these components were made at
some point by one of your peers, so you should feel confident that you can
accomplish any of them.

There is no requirement that you use any of the components listed above.
If you want to model something else, go for it! Very common early object
projects usually attempt to model real-world systems like banks, cars,
etc. Make of this whatever seems interesting to you, and keep in mind that
you're just brainstorming right now. You do not have to commit to anything.

### Example Component

To help you brainstorm a few components, we've provided an example below of a
component you already know well: NaturalNumber. We highly recommend that you
mirror the formatting as close as possible in your designs. By following this
format, we can be more confident that your designs will be possible.

- Example Component: `NaturalNumber`
  - **Description**:
    - The purpose of this component is to model a non-negative
      integer. Our intent with this design was to keep a simple kernel that
      provides the minimum functionality needed to represent a natural number.
      Then, we provide more complex mathematical operations in the secondary
      interface.
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - `void multiplyBy10(int k)`: multiplies `this` by 10 and adds `k`
    - `int divideBy10()`: divides `this` by 10 and reports the remainder
    - `boolean isZero()`: reports whether `this` is zero
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - `void add(NaturalNumber n)`: adds `n` to `this`
    - `void subtract(NaturalNumber n)`: subtracts `n` from `this`
    - `void multiply(NaturalNumber n)`: multiplies `this` by `n`
    - `NaturalNumber divide(NaturalNumber n)`: divides `this` by `n`, returning
      the remainder
    - ...
  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes, basically all OSU components have to be mutable as long as they
        inherit from Standard. `clear`, `newInstance`, and `transferFrom` all
        mutate `this`.
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - No. All methods work with integers or other NaturalNumbers.
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - Yes. NaturalNumber is base 10, and we track that in a constant called
          `RADIX`.
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Yes. The kernel methods `multiplyBy10` and `divideBy10` can be used to
        manipulate our natural number as needed. For example, to implement
        `increment`, we can trim the last digit off with `divideBy10`, add 1 to
        it, verify that the digit hasn't overflown, and multiply the digit back.
        If the digit overflows, we reset it to zero and recursively call
        `increment`.

Keep in mind that the general idea when putting together these layered designs
is to put the minimal implementation in the kernel. In this case, the kernel is
only responsible for manipulating a digit at a time in the number. The secondary
methods use these manipulations to perform more complex operations like
adding two numbers together.

Also, keep in mind that we don't know the underlying implementation. It would be
completely reasonable to create a `NaturalNumber1L` class which layers the
kernel on top of the existing `BigInteger` class in Java. It would also be
reasonable to implement `NaturalNumber2` on top of `String` as seen in
Project 2. Do not worry about your implementations at this time.

On top of everything above, there is no expectation that you have a perfect
design. Part of the goal of this project is to have you actually use your
component once it's implemented to do something interesting. At which point, you
will likely refine your design to make your implementation easier to use.

### Component Designs

> Please use this section to share your designs.

- Component Design #1: PlayerChar
  - **Description**:
    - The purpose of this method would be to model a player character from a
    game like dungeons and dragons. There should be several different stats
    such as health and inventory, and the ability to reset certain stats back
    to a max/default value.
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - `void setDefault()`: sets all current, mutable stat values to be their
    new default values
    - `void rest()`: resets all current, mutable stat values back to their
    default values
    - `void setLevel(int)`: sets the current level to the int parameter
    - `void setHP(int)`: sets the current health to the int parameter
    - `void addAbility(String, int, int)`: adds an ability with the name of the
    first parameter, current uses of the second parameter, and max uses of the
    third parameter
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - `boolean heal(int)`: increases (or decreases) the current health by the
    int parameter
    - `boolean use(String)`: "uses" an ability and lowers the current uses by 1
  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes, this component should have values that can be easily changed
      without having to make an entire new PlayerChar, such as the frequent
      changing of health or use of abilities.
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - I can see this being made quite easily with the use of the OSU Map and
      Map.Pair, however a 2D array may also work. It may also require an
      internal PlayerChar.Ability "pair" to help keep track of stats, or
      PlayerChar.Loot similar to a map to keep track of loot/inventory.
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - I am unsure but I do not believe so
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Yes, the kernal methods are used for the general manipulation of the
      component, while the kernal methods are used for more specifics. For
      example, heal() heals or damages a specific amount rather than just setting the
      health to a specific value like setHP().

- Component Design #2: Loot
  - **Description**:
    - This component is meant to be used as a sample storage that contains
    items, their amounts, and their descriptions
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - `void add(String, String, int)`: adds the desired item with
    parameters listed in the order "name, description, string"
    - `Loot.Item removeAny()`: removes and returns an arbitrary item
    - `boolean hasItem(String)`: returns if there is an item with the name of
    the parameter String
    - `String description(String)`: returns the description of the item with
    the name of the parameter String
    - `int amount(String)`: returns the amount of the item with
    the name of the parameter String
    - `int size()`: returns the number of items in this
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - `void amountChange(String, int)`: changes the amount of the item with
    the name of the parameter String, adding the int value
    - `Loot.Item remove(String)`: removes and returns an item with the name of
    the String parameter
    - `int total()`: returns the total number of items in this, including
    individual amounts of items
  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes, this would have to easily change as items are added or changed
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - Yes, it would use Loot.Item similar to Map.Pair, to store the name,
      amount, and description of all items in the loot
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - I do not believe so
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Yes, the kernal methods are able to do the base functions required to
      manipulate the component, but altering them in more specific ways
      requires the secondary methods. For example, you can remove a specific
      item with remove() by removing arbitrary items until you find the
      matching item, then adding all the other items back into the loot.

- Component Design #3: Roller
  - **Description**:
    - A component meant to mimic the use of rolling a die with the ability to
    add modifiers like +2 or advantage
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - `void setMax(int)`: sets the maximum possible roll value (such as 6 for a
    d6, or standard die)
    - `void setVantage(int)`: sets the number of times the die will be rolled
    with advantage or disadvantage. Positive numbers means take the highest
    value out of the parameter number of rolls +1, and if negative then the
    lowest value out of the parameter number of rolls -1. 0 would just be one
    single roll.
    - `void setMod(int)`: sets the number to be added to the roll upon rolling
    - `int roll()`: rolls the die according to the specifications
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - `int rollMod(int)`: rolls the die and returns the total value plus the
    integer used in the parameter
    - `int rollMany(int)`: rolls the die a number of times listed in the
    parameter and returns the total value
  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - While in the current explanation it is, I believe it could be easily
      made immutable with a more complex constructor
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - No, all methods work with integers and the Roller
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - I am unsure
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Yes, all of the secondary methods can be made using the kernal methods,
      the original component, and addition. For example, rollMany can be
      implemented by repeatedly calling roll and adding the results together.

## Post-Assignment

The following sections detail everything that you should do once you've
completed the assignment.

### Changelog

At the end of every assignment, you should update the
[CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) file found in the root of the project folder.
Since this is likely the first time you've done this, we would recommend
browsing the existing file. It includes all of the changes made to the portfolio
project template. When you're ready, you should delete this file and start your
own. Here's what I would expect to see at the minimum:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/) of
the following form: YYYY.0M.0D.

## YYYY.MM.DD

### Added

- Designed a <!-- insert name of component 1 here --> component
- Designed a <!-- insert name of component 2 here --> component
- Designed a <!-- insert name of component 3 here --> component
```

Here `YYYY.MM.DD` would be the date of your submission, such as 2024.04.21.

You may notice that things are nicely linked in the root CHANGELOG. If you'd
like to accomplish that, you will need to make GitHub releases after each pull
request merge (or at least tag your commits). This is not required.

In the future, the CHANGELOG will be used to document changes in your
designs, so we can gauge your progress. Please keep it updated at each stage
of development.

### Submission

If you have completed the assignment using this template, we recommend that
you convert it to a PDF before submission. If you're not sure how, check out
this [Markdown to PDF guide][markdown-to-pdf-guide]. However, PDFs should be
created for you automatically every time you save, so just double check that
all your work is there before submitting. For future assignments, you will
just be submitting a link to a pull request. This will be the only time
you have to submit any PDFs.

### Peer Review

<!-- TODO: review the peer review guidelines then delete this comment -->

Following the completion of this assignment, you will be assigned three
students' component brainstorming assignments for review. Your job during the
peer review process is to help your peers flesh out their designs. Specifically,
you should be helping them determine which of their designs would be most
practical to complete this semester. When reviewing your peers' assignments,
please treat them with respect. Note also that we can see your comments, which
could help your case if you're looking to become a grader. Ultimately, we
recommend using the following feedback rubric to ensure that your feedback is
both helpful and respectful (you may want to render the markdown as HTML or a
PDF to read this rubric as a table).
